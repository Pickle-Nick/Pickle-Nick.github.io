 *  FUNCTIONS
 *
 *      A function in JavaScript is a block of code desiged to perform a desired task. We must 
 *      invoke the function to call it and use its properties. Functions are creted by 
 *      using the function keyword followed by the name of the function we are creating.
 *      Next we input our parameters, functions can have none or multiple parameters. Lastly we return
 *      what we want our outcome to be for example:
 *              function addFunction(a,b) {
 *              return a +b;
 *              }
 *              console.log(addFuntion(5, 16)); //=> console prints 21
 *
 *      We create these functions in our code to reuse them over and over instead of having to 
 *      hard code every time. We can reuse the same function with different arguments to get different
 *      vales.
 *
 *              function writeName(firstName, lastName) { 
 *                  rerturn firstName + '' + lastName; //=> this function will return the addition of 2 strings
 *                                                          with a space in the middle seperating the strings.
 *
 *      The difference between a functions parameters and a functions arguements are, the parameters are declared
 *      when creating a funtion. Arguments, however are only declare once the function is invoked or called to use.
